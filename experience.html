      <h2>Data Analyst Intern</h2>
      <h3>Telos Air | Feb 2024 - Sept 2024</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Streamlined topics from real data using Apache Kafka and configured ETL processes with Apache Airflow, automating data orchestration workflows from Kafka to databases.</li>
        <li>Queried and analyzed time-series data using Python, focusing on smooth curve patterns and extremum identification through peak and valley detection algorithms.</li>
        <li>Applied exponential curve-fitting techniques and sliding window algorithms for temporal data processing to discern long-term trends in air quality data.</li>
        <li>Developed visualizations (scatter plots, line plots) using Matplotlib to analyze relationships between cumulative total Pn03 and pn03 ratio across multiple sensors.</li>
        <li>Engineered new features like normalized pn03 ratio and conducted linear regression analysis to explore relationships between cumulative totals and sensor ratios.</li>
        <li>Built Python scripts with gRPC to interface with ChirpStack APIs for creating Gateways and developed a Lambda function using JavaScript to trigger SNS notifications integrated with ChirpStack.</li>
        <li>Worked on a project focused on real-time environmental data collection and analysis, capturing CO2 levels, temperature, and particle concentrations (PN03, PN05, PN10, PM0.3) from multiple sensors.</li>
        <li>Designed and consumed RESTful APIs to push processed data into dashboards and retrieve metadata for sensor configurations, ensuring seamless system integration.</li>
        <li>Analyzed air quality data to detect anomalies and identify sensor replacements or ventilation requirements, optimizing fresh air needs for classrooms based on CO2 patterns.</li>
        <li>Utilized statistical tools to study particle emissions, identifying frequently repeating sensors and flow patterns of air quality changes.</li>
